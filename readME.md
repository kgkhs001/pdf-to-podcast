Steps to running this code
1. Make sure you are running Python 3.9.6 or 3.10
2. Make a Venv - run `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Run the venv - run `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required libraries - run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If your python version is correct then you will be able to easily install all of these. 
5. Run the program -run `python3 main.py`

Note that all the `python3` can be replaced by `python` depending on your machine. But if one doesn't work try the other.

MAKE SURE YOU ADD YOUR .env VARIABLES.
